This project is a modified version of the [Pok√©mon Randomizer](https://github.com/Ajarmar/universal-Pokemon-randomizer-zx/releases), by Dabomstew and Ajarmar. To use it, go to the releases and download & extract the zip file, and then use it in place of the normal randomizer (using the launcher if needed).

It adds some settings to the randomizer that are intended to be particularly useful to those playing the [Ironmon Challenge](ironmon.gg). These features range from minor quality-of-life improvements to removing significant obstacles that can impact the game.

You are free to use this for whatever you want. However, if you're playing Ironmon, make sure to disclose somewhere which of these tweaks you are doing.

This is updated somewhat sporadically. Feel free to message me on Discord (Something_Smart#8109) for any issues or feature requests.
